## 🎯 What Remains (Minimal & Purposeful)

### **Animations**
1. **Simple fade-in** on scroll (0.5s duration)
2. **Staggered delays** for cards (0.1s per item - barely noticeable)
3. **Scroll indicator bounce** (smooth, continuous)
4. **Color transitions** on hover (subtle, fast)

### **Background**
1. Single static gradient (accent/5 opacity)
2. Minimal grid pattern (3% opacity)

### **Interactions**
1. Hover color changes (text/borders)
2. Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
3. No scale, rotate, or transform effects

## 📊 Before vs After

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Background layers** | 6+ animated elements | 2 static elements |
| **Animation delays** | Up to 3.5s | Max 0.5s |
| **Hover effects** | Scale, rotate, translate | Color only |
| **Complexity** | High (multiple layers) | Low (single purpose) |
| **Load performance** | Heavy (many animations) | Light (minimal motion) |
