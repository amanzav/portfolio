- **Stagger effects**: Items appear in sequence, not all at once
- **Spring physics**: Natural, bouncy movements
- **Micro-interactions**: Small delights on hover/tap
- **Performance optimized**: Uses Framer Motion's optimized animations

## ðŸŽ¯ What Makes It Unique

1. **Typewriter name**: More engaging than static text
2. **Animated counters**: Makes numbers feel more impressive
3. **Floating orbs**: Adds life without being distracting
4. **Icon animations**: Each section icon has its own personality
5. **Smooth transitions**: Everything flows naturally
6. **Hover surprises**: Interactive elements throughout

## ðŸš€ How to Customize

```tsx
<TypewriterEffect text="Your Name" duration={2.5} />
```

### Adjust Counter Target
```tsx
<Counter value={25000} suffix="+" />
```

### Modify Floating Elements
Edit `floating-elements.tsx` to add/remove orbs or change colors and speeds.

## ðŸ“± Responsive & Accessible
